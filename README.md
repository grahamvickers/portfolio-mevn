# Bizz.Net - Interactive Media Specialist Thesis Project

With this application I have created my own personal web development portfolio utilizing the MEVN stack and using Docker to run the local server.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

You must have docker installed locally to run this version of Bizz Net. Don't have it? Click [HERE](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to download the latest version!

### Installing

You will need to copy and paste the following into a local terminal, in order to run the website:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/grahamvickers/portfolio-mevn
```
now run this command.

### Deployment 

Now in the terminal again, run the following command to launch the app
```
$ docker-compose up
```

You can now go to [localhost:8002](https://localhost:8002) in a web broswer of your choice
